NMControl
=========

NMControl should be used whenever you want to read name data from the blockchain.  It has high-level API's for common namespaces, and can cache data for improved performance.  (For creating transactions, working with wallets, or reading blockchain data other than standard name/value data, use Namecoind.)

NMControl is accessed via JSON-RPC over TCP.
